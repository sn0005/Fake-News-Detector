# Fake-News-Detector
As a part of data science project, I built this model to predict news which are reliable and unreliable. The datasets used in this project were from kaggle.com. Highly appreciate the comment from readers on imporvement or alternative approach that could be made to have better accuracy.
Dataset consist of two seperate file for train and test. Since the file size should be less than 24MB I'm unable to upload the files here. If you are interested you could download them from https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news
If you are copying the ipynb file make sure that while running kindly change the directory path as yours. I code here reflects my default directory where the files are stored.
Thanks.
